# VolumePad

Proof of concept of a numpad / macropad with motorized faders to control volume. Fader position is also updated if you change the volume on the pc.

Main problem it tries to solve is noicy friends in discord while your are trying to clutch a csgo match

Code is too embarrising to publish to github at this moment tbh, linux only atm

PCB needs quite some adjusments before it works so please don't order one (used a worng moter driver on this version)
