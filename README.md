# VolumePad

Proof of concept of a numpad / macropad with motorized faders to control volume. Fader position is also updated if you change the volume on the pc.

The main problem it tries to solve is noisy friends in discord while you are trying to clutch a csgo match

The code is too embarrassing to publish to github at this moment tbh, linux only atm

PCB needs quite some adjustments before it works so please don't order one (used the wrong motor driver on this version)
